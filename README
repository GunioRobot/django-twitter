django-twitter allows your users to login into your application using Twitter

Write {{url twitte_bebin_auth}} in your view inside your template. 
When the user is redirected from Twitter to your application, django-twitter raises token_received signal. 
You can do whatever you want with the tokens received from Twitter. 

How To Use
==========
1. Add 'twitter' to your apps list

2. Add in settings.py:
    CONSUMER_KEY = "your_consumer_key" 
    CONSUMER_SECRET = "your_consumer_secret" 
    AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE = 'twitter.ProfileUser' 
    CALLBACK_URL = 'your_awesome_url' 

CONSUMER_KEY: You can obtain it from your Twitter account. 
CONSUMER_SECRET: You can obtain it from your Twitter account. 
AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE: django-twitter uses an user profile to store the credentials from Twitter. 
AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE: You need to specify this profile:'twitter.ProfileUser'.
CALLBACK_URL: is the url inside your application that should be shown when the authentication process went ok. It must be same as Twitter callback url. 

3. Connect with tokens_received signal: 

from twitter import signals

def tokens_received(sender, request, screen_name, oauth_token, oauth_token_secret, **kwargs):
    #Your stuff here

signals.tokens_received.connect(tokens_received)

How it works
============
To insert the link to Twitter, in your template include this: '{% url twitter_begin_auth %}'. 
Then the user is redirected to Twitter. 
When the username and password is inserted, then redirects to CALLBACK_URL in your application and tokens_received signal is raised.

NOTE:
-----
Remember that your Twitter callback url must be the same as CALLBACK_URL

Dependencies
============
djano-twitter uses Django 1.3 and oauth2
